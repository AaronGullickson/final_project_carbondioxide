# Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Urbanization

Carbon dioxide emissions through the consumption of fossil fuels are one of the primary causes of global warming. We know that population growth and levels of consumption both play an important role in a country’s carbon dioxide emissions, but the role of other factors is less clear. For example, increasing population density through urbanization is believed to have some positive environmental benefit by reducing sprawl and travel distances. On the other hand, greater urbanization is tied to higher levels of manufacturing and consumption. We will use the cross-national data to address the following research questions:

1. What is the effect of urbanization and population density on carbon dioxide emissions per capita? Pay careful attention to the effect of these two variables with and without controlling for the other variable.
2. Does the effect of urbanization vary by the income level of the country? 

For both of these questions, you should consider controls for a country’s income level, relative size of the working age population, foreign direct investments, and exports. 

We will use data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. This database contains cross-national data over time for most countries in the world. We will use data from 2010 to examine predictors of carbon dioxide emissions per capita. The data and more information about the dataset and variables are available in the `input` directory.
